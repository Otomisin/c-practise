    "**What's a file?**\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, a file is a contiguous set of bytes used to store data. This data is organized in a specific format and can be anything as simple as a text file or as complicated as a program executable. In the end, these byte files are then translated into binary 1 and 0 for easier processing by the computer.\n",
    "Files on most modern file systems are composed of three main parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Header:** metadata about the contents of the file (file name, size, type, and so on)\n",
    "2. **Data:** contents of the file as written by the creator or editor\n",
    "3. **End of file (EOF):** special character that indicates the end of the file\n",
    "\n",
    "What a file represent depends on the extension of the file, some examples are pdf, gif,  tif. There are thousands of [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_filename_extensions) out there.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Considerations in reading and opening a file**<br>\n",
    "**LINE ENDINGS**\n",
    "Some other consideration when reading and writing a file is the LINE ENDING. Line ending are also know as newline characters that indicate the end of a line of a text. Different operatiing systems use different characters to represent line endings:\n",
    "  - Unix and Linux use a single newline character (/n)\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "    Pug/r\n",
    "    /n\n",
    "    Jack Russell Terrier/r\n",
    "    /n\n",
    "    English Springer Spaniel/r\n",
    "    /n\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  - Windows uses two characters, a carriage return followed by a newline (/r/n)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Pug/r/n\n",
    "    Jack Russell Terrier/r/n\n",
    "    English Springer Spaniel/r/n\n",
    "    German Shepherd/r/n\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  - Macintosh systems prior to Mac OS X use a single carriage return (/r)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Character Encodings** Another consideration is common problem is the Character Encodings. An encoding is a translation from byte data to human readable characters, which is done by assigning a numerical value to human readable chracters. The two most common encodings are the [ASCII](https://www.ascii-code.com/)\n",
    " and [UNICODE](https://home.unicode.org/)  Formats. It’s important to note that parsing a file with the incorrect character encoding can lead to failures or misrepresentation of the characte\n",
    "\n",
    "**Opneing and closing a file** You can open a file with  open() built-in function open() and close it in two ways; The first is file.close() and the second way to close a file is to use the with statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default and most common is 'r', which represents opening the file in read-only mode as a text file. Other modes includes;\n",
    "\n",
    "| Mode | Function |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| r | Open a file for reading. This is the default mode. |\n",
    "| w | Open a file for writing. If the file already exists, overwrite its contents. Create a new file if the file does not exist. |\n",
    "| a | Open a file for appending. Preserve the file’s contents, add new data to the end of the file. |\n",
    "| r+ | Open a file for reading and writing. |\n",
    "| w+ | Allows to write as well as read from the file. |\n",
    "| a+ | Allows appending as well as reading from the file. |\n",

    "| [.readline(size = 1)](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/io.html#io.IOBase.readline) | This reads at most size number of characters from the line. This continues to the end of the line and then wraps back around. If no argument is passed or None or -1 is passed, then the entire line (or rest of the line) is read. |\n",
