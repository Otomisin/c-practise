    "## What are web applications and why are they needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "Web Applications: A web application is a software program that runs on a web server and is accessed through a web browser over the internet. It is designed to serve a specific purpose, such as managing online sales, facilitating communication, or providing access to data. Web applications are needed because they allow users to interact with complex systems without having to install software on their computers. Examples of web applications include online banking, email, social media platforms like Facebook, and e-commerce websites like Amazon.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "**CMS vs Framework:**\n",
    "- A content management system (CMS) is a software application that allows users to create, manage, and publish digital content. It provides a user-friendly interface for content creation and editing, as well as tools for organizing and displaying content. Examples of CMS include WordPress, Drupal, and Joomla.\n",
    "\t\t\n",
    "- On the other hand, a web framework is a software tool that provides a structure for building web applications. It is a collection of libraries, modules, and tools that developers use to create web applications quickly and efficiently. A framework provides a set of rules and conventions for building web applications, making it easier for developers to create complex applications. Examples of web frameworks include Ruby on Rails, Django, and Laravel.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a CMS is primarily used for managing digital content, while a web framework is used for building web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of Web Frameworks:** \n",
    "There are two types of web frameworks: server-side and client-side.\n",
    "- Server-side frameworks are used to build applications that run on the server-side, meaning that the server is responsible for generating the HTML that is sent to the client's web browser. Examples of server-side frameworks include Ruby on Rails, Django, and Laravel.\n",
    "\t\t\n",
    "- Client-side frameworks are used to build applications that run on the client-side, meaning that the web browser is responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user interactions. Examples of client-side frameworks include AngularJS, ReactJS, and VueJS.\n",

    "#### Installing a new environment for flask\n",
    "1. First create an environment \n",
    "- `python -n venv appenv` in the direcotry terminal of your working environment\n",
    "2. To activate, type\n",
    "- `Source appenv/Scripts/activate`\n",
    "3. Then install flask\n",
    "- `pip instal flask`\n",
    "4. To keep track of your dependencies file,create a text:\n",
    "- `pip freeze > requirements.txt`\n",

    "#### **Routing in Flask**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Flask, routing refers to the process of mapping a URL endpoint to a particular Python function that handles the request and generates an appropriate response. he Flask application defines various routes that map to different URL endpoints, and when a user visits a particular URL, Flask matches the requested URL with one of the defined routes and executes the associated Python function, also known as a view function, to generate a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Routing in Flask is typically done using the @app.route() decorator, which is used to define a new route. The decorator takes the URL pattern as its argument and associates it with the view function that handles the request for that particular URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example the following code defines a route to `/hello` endpoint:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from flask import Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/hello')\n",
    "def hello_world():\n",
    "    return 'Hello, World!'\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of `strict_slashes=False`\n",
    "\n",
    "The **strict_slashes=False** statement in the code is a configuration option for the Flask app object. By setting strict_slashes to False, Flask will automatically redirect URLs with a trailing slash to the same endpoint without the slash. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the user navigates to http://localhost:5000/\n",
    " in their browser, Flask will return the response from the hello_hbnb()\n",
    " function. If the user navigates to http://localhost:5000\n",
    " (without the trailing slash), Flask will still return the same response, because the strict_slashes=False\n",
    " configuration allows for flexibility in the URL structure."
