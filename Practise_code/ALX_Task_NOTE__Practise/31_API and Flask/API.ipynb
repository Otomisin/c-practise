    "Old-school system administrators usually only know Bash and that is what they use to build their scripts. While Bash is perfectly fine for a lot of things, it can quickly get messy and not efficient compared to other programming languages. The new generation of system administrators, usually called SREs, are pretty much regular software engineers but instead of building products, they are managing systems. And one of the big differences with their predecessors is that they know more than just Bash scripting.\n",
    "\n",
    "One popular way to expose an application and dataset is to use an API. Often, they are the public facing part of websites and micro-services so that allow outsiders to interact with them – access and modify their data. In this project, you will access employee data via an API to organize and export them to different data structures.\n",

    "## **Concept and Terms**\n",
    "\n",
    "**WHat is an API?**\n",
    "\n",
    "An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of protocols, routines, and tools for building software applications. APIs define how different software components should interact with each other, making it easier for developers to create complex applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs allow developers to access data and functionality from other applications or services, allowing them to build applications that leverage the features of other systems. For example, a developer could use the Twitter API to build an application that displays tweets from a user's timeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "**WHat is REST API**\n",
    "\n",
    "A REST (Representational State Transfer) API is a type of API that uses HTTP requests to access and manipulate data. REST APIs use standard HTTP methods (such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE) to perform operations on resources, which are identified by URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers).\n",
    "\n",
    "REST APIs are designed to be stateless, meaning that each request contains all the information necessary for the server to fulfill the request. This makes REST APIs highly scalable and allows them to handle large amounts of traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "REST APIs provide access to web service data through public web URLs. For examples, here is github's REST API to get informations about a user: `https://api.github.com/users/<username>`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Principles of the REST architectural style**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Client-Server: This means that there are two parts to a RESTful system: the client (which is usually a web browser or a mobile app) and the server (which is usually a web application or a database). The client and server communicate with each other using HTTP requests and responses.\n",
    "2. Stateless: This means that each request from the client to the server contains all the information the server needs to fulfill the request. The server doesn't keep any information about previous requests or sessions.\n",
    "3. Cacheable: This means that responses from the server can be cached (stored) by the client so that they can be reused later. This can make the system faster and reduce server load.\n",
    "4. Uniform Interface: This means that the server provides a uniform interface for clients to access resources. Resources are identified using URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) and can be accessed using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.\n",
    "5. Layered System: This means that there can be multiple layers between the client and the server, and each layer can provide additional functionality like caching, load balancing, orsecurity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Microservice**\n",
    "\n",
    "Microservices are a type of architectural pattern that involves breaking down a large application into smaller, independent services. Each microservice is responsible for a specific task and communicates with other services through APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Microservices allow for greater flexibility and scalability than monolithic applications. They also make it easier to deploy and maintain applications, as changes to one microservice do not affect the entire application.\n",
    "\n",
    "**HTTP Methods Review**\n",
    "HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the underlying protocol used to communicate on the World Wide Web. HTTP defines a set of request methods, or \"verbs\", that indicate the desired action to be performed on a resource. HTTP methods provide a way for client applications to interact with web servers and manipulate resources on the web.\n",
    "\n",
    " The most commonly used HTTP methods are:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. **GET:** The GET method is **used to retrieve a resource from the server**. When a GET request is made, the server returns the requested resource in the response body. GET requests should only retrieve data and should not modify any data on the server.\n",
    "1. **POST:** The POST method is used to submit data to be processed by the server. When a POST request is made, the data is sent in the request body. This method is commonly used for submitting forms or uploading files to a server.\n",
    "2. **PUT:** The PUT method is used to update a resource on the server. When a PUT request is made, the data to be updated is sent in the request body. PUT requests are idempotent, meaning that multiple identical requests should have the same effect as a single request.\n",
    "3. **DELETE:** The DELETE method is used to delete a resource from the server. When a DELETE request is made, the specified resource is removed from the server.\n",
    "4. **HEAD:** The HEAD method is similar to the GET method, but it only retrieves the headers of the response, not the response body. This method is often used to check the status of a resource, such as whether it exists or has been modified.\n",
    "5. **OPTIONS:** The OPTIONS method is used to retrieve the supported methods for a resource. When an OPTIONS request is made, the server returns a list of the methods that are allowed for that resource.\n",
    "6. **PATCH:** The PATCH method is used to partially update a resource on the server. When a PATCH request is made, the data to be updated is sent in the request body, but only the specified fields are updated.\n",
    "7. **CONNECT:** The CONNECT method is used to establish a network connection to a resource, typically for use with a proxy server.\n",
    "8. **TRACE:** The TRACE method is used to retrieve a diagnostic trace of the request and response messages for a resource. This method is mainly used for debugging purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**API Endpoints**\n",
    "\n",
    "A REST API exposes a set of public URLs that client applications use to access the resources of a web service. These URLs, in the context of an API, are called endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help further clarify this, take a look at the table below. In this table, you’ll see API endpoints for a *hypothetical CRM system*. These endpoints are for a customer resource that represents potential customers in the system:\n",
    "\n",
    "| HTTP method | API endpoint | Description |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| GET | /customers | Get a list of customers. |\n",
    "| GET | /customers/<customer_id> | Get a single customer. |\n",
    "| POST | /customers | Create a new customer. |\n",
    "| PUT | /customers/<customer_id> | Update a customer. |\n",
    "| PATCH | /customers/<customer_id> | Partially update a customer. |\n",
    "| DELETE | /customers/<customer_id> | Delete a customer. |\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the endpoints above performs a different action based on the HTTP method. Note, that the base URL for the endpoints has been omitted for brevity. In reality, you’ll need the full URL path to access an API endpoint: https://api.example.com/customers"

    "To write code that interacts with REST APIs, most Python developers turn to `requests` or `urlib` to send HTTP requests. This library abstracts away the complexities of making HTTP requests. It’s one of the few projects worth treating as if it’s part of the standard library.\n",
