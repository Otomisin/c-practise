    "### Why JavaScript programming is amazing:\n",
    "JavaScript is an amazing programming language because it can be used for both frontend and backend web development. It is also easy to learn and has a wide range of libraries and frameworks that make development faster and more efficient. Additionally, JavaScript is constantly evolving and improving, with new features being added all the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to run a JavaScript script:\n",
    "There are several ways to run a JavaScript script. One way is to create an HTML file and include the script using a script tag. Another way is to use the Node.js runtime environment to run JavaScript code directly from the command line. You can also use a web browser console to run JavaScript code.\n"

    "### How to create variables and constants:\n",
    "To create a variable in JavaScript, you can use the **`var`**, **`let`**, or **`const`** keyword followed by a variable name. For example: [variables](./JavaFiles/Variables.js).\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "%%javascript # Use in Jupyternote book\n",
    "var myVariable = 'Hello';\n",
    "let myOtherVariable = 'World';\n",
    "const myConstant = 42;\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables declared with var and let can be reassigned, while variables declared with const cannot be reassigned\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are the differences between var, const, and let:**\n",
    "\n",
    "var is an **older way of declaring variables** in JavaScript and has some quirks related to scoping. let and const were introduced in ES6 and are more commonly used now. let allows you to declare variables that can be reassigned, while const declares variables that cannot be reassigned. Additionally, const variables must be initialized when they are declared.\n",

    "\n",
    "In JavaScript, you can export values or functions from a module using two different mechanisms: Named Exports and Default Exports.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Named Exports:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create a names export individually or all at once. Named Exports allow you to export multiple values or functions from a module using their respective names. These exports are defined using the `export` keyword, followed by the name of the function or value being exported:\n",
    "```\n",
    "//person.js\n",
    "export const name = \"Jesse\";\n",
    "export const age = 40;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or all at once\n",
    "```\n",
    "//person.js\n",
    "const name = \"Jesse\";\n",
    "const age = 40;\n",
    "\n",
    "export {name, age};\n",
    "```\n",
    "**EXPORTS**\n",
    "**Default Exports:**\n",
    "In defauls you can only have one default export. Default Exports allow you to export a single value or function from a module without specifying its name. When a module is imported, the default export can be assigned to any variable name you choose. These exports are defined using the `export default` syntax, followed by the value or function being exported:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "//person.js\n",
    "const message = () => {\n",
    "const name = \"Jesse\";\n",
    "const age = 40;\n",
    "return name + ' is ' + age + 'years old.';\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "export default message;\n",
    "```\n",
    "or \n",

    "export default const message = () => {\n",
    "const name = \"Jesse\";\n",

    "};\n",

    "**IMPORTS**\n",
    "You can import modules into a file in two ways, based on if they are named exports or default exports.\n",

    "```\n",
    "import { name, age } from \"./person.js\";\n",

    "#### **Difference between `modules.export` and `export default`**\n",
    "`module.exports` and `export default` are both mechanisms for exporting values or functions from a module in JavaScript, but they are used in different module systems and are not interchangeable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**module.exports** is used in CommonJS, which is the module system used in Node.js. In this system, you assign a value to module.exports to export it from a module. For example, the following code exports a Rectangle class using module.exports:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Rectangle {\n",
    "  constructor(width, height) {\n",
    "    this.width = width;\n",
    "    this.height = height;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "\n",
    "  get area() {\n",
    "    return this.width * this.height;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "module.exports = Rectangle;\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "On the other hand, `export default` is used in ECMAScript modules (ESM), which is a standardized module system used in modern web browsers and supported by many tools such as webpack, Rollup, and Babel. In this system, you can export a value or function as the `default export` of a module using the export default syntax. For example, the following code exports a `Rectangle` class as the default export of a module:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "export default class Rectangle {\n",
    "  constructor(width, height) {\n",
    "    this.width = width;\n",
    "    this.height = height;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "\n",
    "  get area() {\n",
    "    return this.width * this.height;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "When you import a module that uses `module.exports`, you use `require()` to load the module and get the exported value. When you import a module that uses `export default`, you use `import` to load the module and get the default exported value. Here are examples of importing modules that use both types of exports:\n",
    "```\n",
    "// Importing a module that uses module.exports\n",
    "const Rectangle = require('./Rectangle');\n",
    "\n",
    "const r = new Rectangle(5, 10);\n",
    "console.log(r.area);  // Output: 50\n",
    "\n",
    "// Importing a module that uses export default\n",
    "import Rectangle from './Rectangle';\n",
    "\n",
    "const r = new Rectangle(5, 10);\n",
    "console.log(r.area);  // Output: 50\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that in ECMAScript modules, you can also use Named Exports along with Default Exports, whereas in CommonJS you can only use Named Exports.\n",
