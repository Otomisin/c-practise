    "**`doctest`** and **`unittest`** are both Python libraries that are used for testing code, but they have some important differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`doctest`** is a testing framework that allows you to write tests in the docstring of a function or module. The tests are written as examples in the docstring, and **`doctest`** extracts and runs them automatically. This can be a convenient way to ensure that examples in documentation stay up to date with changes to the code, and can help catch errors early in development. **`doctest`** is often used for smaller projects or for testing specific functions within a larger project.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In summary, you can use `doctest` for the following purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Writing **quick and effective test cases** to check your code as you write it\n",
    "  - Running **acceptance**, **regression**, and **integration** test cases on your projects, packages, and modules\n",
    "  - Checking if your **docstrings** are **up-to-date** and in **sync** with the target code\n",
    "  - Verifying if your projects’ **documentation** is **up-to-date**\n",
    "  - Writing **hands-on tutorials** for your projects, packages, and modules\n",
    "  - Illustrating how to **use your projects’ APIs** and what the expected input and output must be.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can view the docstring by running ```help(name_of_function_or_method)```\n",
    "\n",
    "- In shell you can test your doctest by running ```$ python -m doctest pythonFile.py``` . Running doctest with the -v option produces detailed output that describes the test-running process. in this case you use ```$ python -m doctest -v pythonFile.py```\n",
