The method updates the mileage instance variable of the Car object by adding the distance parameter to it and then prints a message that indicates the amount of distance driven and the total mileage of the car.\n",

    "\n",
    "- What are getters and setters?\n",
    "    - **Getter:** A method that allows you to *access* an attribute in a given class.  It returns the targets attribute’s value.\n",
    "    - **Setter:** A method that allows you to *set* or *mutate* the value of an attribute in a class. It takes a new value and assign it to the underlying attribute, hence updating the value.\n",
    "    - Why use getters and setters?\n",
    "        - Getters and Setter allow you to access and mutate private attributes while maintaining **encapsulation (***Encapsulation is **a way to restrict the direct access to some components of an object** , so users cannot access state values for all of the variables of a particular object. Encapsulation can be used to hide both data members and data functions or methods associated with an instantiated class or object***)**\n",
    "        - Setter and getters are not the same in other programing languages\n",
    "        - The main purpose of using setters and getters in OOP is ensure data encapsulation.\n",
    "        - To avoid direct access of a class field i.e. private variables cannot be accessed directly or modified by external user\n",
    "    - If you expose the attributes of a class to your users, then those attributes automatically become part of the class’s public [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API). They’ll be **public attributes**, which means that your users will directly access and mutate the attributes in their code.\n",
    "- How to write **getter** and **setter** methods in your classes\n",

    "## Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding are three important concepts in Object-Oriented Programming that are used to design and implement software systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Abstraction** refers to the process of defining a __simplified interface for complex data structures or systems__. In other words, it is the process of hiding complex details and exposing only the essential features of an object or system to the user. The user does not need to know how the object works internally, they only need to know how to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a car. A driver does not need to know how the engine works internally or how the transmission system operates. The driver only needs to know how to start the car, accelerate, brake, and change gears. The details of how the car works internally are abstracted away from the driver.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Encapsulation** is the process of packaging data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit. This concept is also known as information hiding. Encapsulation provides a mechanism for restricting access to the data and methods of an object. It ensures that the data is accessed only through the methods defined in the class and not directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a bank account. A bank account has data such as the account number, account balance, and account holder name, and methods such as deposit, withdraw, and check balance. The data and methods of the bank account are encapsulated in a class. The data is accessed only through the methods defined in the class, and not directly. This ensures that the data is protected from unauthorized access and modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Information Hiding** refers to the process of hiding the implementation details of an object from the user. The user does not need to know how the object works internally, they only need to know how to use it. This concept is closely related to Data Abstraction and Data Encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a smartphone. A user does not need to know how the operating system of the smartphone works internally or how the individual components such as the CPU or RAM operate. The user only needs to know how to use the apps on the smartphone, make calls, send messages, and browse the internet. The implementation details of the smartphone are hidden from the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding are important concepts in Object-Oriented Programming that help in designing and implementing software systems that are easy to use, maintain, and modify."
