    "### Processsing command in CMD\n",
    "\n",
    "    When a user enters a command in a **`cmd`**-based application, the **`cmdloop()`** method reads the input and parses it into a command name and arguments. It then looks for a method in the **`cmd`**-derived class that matches the command name.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example, let's say the user enters the command \"hello world\". The **`cmdloop()`** method will parse this input into the command name \"hello\" and the argument \"world\". It will then look for a method in the **`cmd`**-derived class that matches the command name \"hello\". In this case, it will find the **`do_hello`** method, which is defined to handle the \"hello\" command. The method is called with the argument \"world\" as its parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The **`do_*`** methods in a **`cmd`**-derived class should be named with a prefix of **`do_`** followed by the command name. For example, if you want to define a command called \"foo\", you would define a method called **`do_foo`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    If the **`cmdloop()`** method does not find a matching method for the entered command, it will call the **`default()`** method. This method should be defined in the **`cmd`**-derived class to handle commands that don't match any of the **`do_*`** methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The **`default()`** method is passed the entire command line as a string. It can use this string to perform custom processing or display an error message to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "    After a command has been processed, the **`cmdloop()`** method reads the next input line and repeats the process. The loop continues until the **`do_*`** method returns **`True`** or the user enters the \"EOF\" command (typically by pressing Ctrl-D on Unix-like systems or Ctrl-Z on Windows).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adding live help: This help to provide an help documenttatioin in the use of a method. by add help_{method_name}, as in the help_greet in the example below\n",

    "- Auto-Completion[¶](http://pymotw.com/2/cmd/#auto-completion)\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Cmd** includes support for command completion based on the names of the commands with processor methods. The user triggers completion by hitting the tab key at an input prompt. When multiple completions are possible, pressing tab twice prints a list of the options.\n",
    "\n",
    "    `$ python cmd_do_help.py\n",

    "- The first line imports the **`cmd`** module, which provides a framework for building command-line interfaces.\n",
    "- The **`MyCmd`** class defines a new command-line interface. This class extends the **`cmd.Cmd`** class and overrides some of its methods:\n",
    "    - The **`prompt`** attribute specifies the command prompt that the user will see. In this case, it's set to **`'>> '`**.\n",
    "    - The **`intro`** attribute specifies a welcome message that will be printed when the user starts the command-line interface. This message is displayed only once, before the first command is entered.\n",
    "    - The **`do_hello`** method defines a new command called \"hello\". When the user enters this command followed by an argument, the **`do_hello`** method is called with the argument as its parameter. This method simply prints a greeting with the argument.\n",
    "    - The **`do_quit`** method defines a new command called \"quit\". When the user enters this command, the **`do_quit`** method is called with an empty string as its parameter. This method prints a quitting message and returns **`True`**, which signals to the command loop to exit.\n",
    "- The final block of code creates a new instance of the **`MyCmd`** class and starts the command loop by calling the **`cmdloop()`** method. This method runs an infinite loop that reads user input from the console, parses it, and calls the appropriate method defined in the **`MyCmd`** class based on the command entered. The loop continues until one of the methods returns **`True`**."
