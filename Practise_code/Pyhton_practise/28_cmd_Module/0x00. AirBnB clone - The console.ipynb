    "1. We start by importing the **`cmd`** module.\n",
    "2. We create a new class called **`MyCmdInterpreter`** that inherits from **`cmd.Cmd`**. This class defines our custom command interpreter.\n",
    "3. We set two class-level variables: **`prompt`** and **`intro`**. **`prompt`** is the text that will be displayed on the command line to indicate that the interpreter is waiting for input. **`intro`** is the text that will be displayed when the interpreter starts up.\n",
    "4. We define two methods: **`do_hello`** and **`do_quit`**. These methods are the commands that the interpreter will recognize. The **`do_`** prefix is required by the **`cmd`** module to recognize these methods as commands. The **`arg`** parameter is a string that contains the arguments passed to the command. In the case of the **`hello`** command, we use this argument to print a personalized greeting. In the case of the **`quit`** command, we print a goodbye message and return **`True`** to indicate that the interpreter should exit.\n",
    "5. Finally, we check if the script is being run as the main program and create an instance of our **`MyCmdInterpreter`** class. We then call the **`cmdloop`** method to start the interpreter.\n",
