# Technical Requirements and Resources

This section will guide you through the essential aspects of what you'll need in terms of hardware, software, and data resources to make the most of this hackathon experience. The goal is to ensure you with the tools and knowledge required to delve into the complex world of climate change and human mobility in the East and Horn of Africa region.

## Data for hackathon?

Participants will have access to Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) dataset related to the East and Horn of Africa region. These datasets will include information on displacement, climate-related factors, population movements, and more. Here is a list of the datasets youâ€™ll have access to, all georeferenced to Admin 1 for the region of interest. The temporal dimension under consideration for the external data is 2000-2020.

### The use of own/external data?

While the primary focus will be on DTM datasets, participants are encouraged to supplement their research with other publicly available data sources if relevant to their research questions.

### Data format to expect?

The DTM datasets will be provided in standard data formats such as CSV and Excel each with its respective admin1 codes or names for easy mapping to shapefiles for geographic data. More information will be provided to participants on the event day.

### What is Admin Level?

- The concept of "admin_level" is used in geography and mapping to categorize and describe different levels of administrative divisions within a country or region. They mostly range from Admin 0 to Admin 10.

- Here's a simple breakdown:
  - Country Level (admin_level 0): At the top level, you have the entire country or region. For example, in the United States, this would be the entire country.
  - State or Province Level (admin_level 1): Inside the country, you have states or provinces. Think of these as slightly smaller boxes within big country box. For example, in the United States, you might have states like California or New York.
  - County or District Level (admin_level 2): Within states or provinces, you have counties or districts. These are even smaller boxes, like subdivisions within the states. In California, you could have counties like Los Angeles or San Francisco.

# Internet Access

Will there be internet access available during the hackathon for data retrieval or online research?

- Yes, participants will have access to the internet to retrieve additional data, conduct research, and access online resources as needed for their projects.

# Mentors and Experts

Will there be mentors or experts available to assist with technical challenges or data-related questions?

- Yes, there will be mentors or experts on hand to provide guidance, answer technical questions, and assist participants with any challenges related to data analysis and software usage.

# Data Privacy and Ethics

Will there be any data privacy or ethical considerations when working with sensitive data?

- Participants will be expected to adhere to ethical guidelines and data privacy regulations when working with sensitive data. Organizers will provide guidance on these considerations.
